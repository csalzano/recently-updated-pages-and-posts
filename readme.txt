== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.0.0 =
Changes tested up to version number to 5.9.0. Implements semantic version numbers starting with 1.0.0. Now specifies post types of `post` or `page` when querying posts. Adds a text domain and makes all strings translatable.

= 0.120223 = 
This plugin now works better on less code. I was able to use a built in WP function I never knew of, wp_trim_words.

= 0.120218 =
This update contains two fixes after the last release. I introduced more features than I intended with the last update. This update removes the original post date from showing in the widget below each post title. I also introduced excerpts as a new feature, but users that do not want excerpts to show did not have a way to maintain that behavior. Now, an excerpt length of 0 words will not show any post excerpt.

= 0.120212 =
This update improves the code to the 2.8 Widget API and adds an option to choose your own excerpt length.

= 0.101219 =
This version introduces CSS friendly HTML elements and a widget options screen. The title of the widget and the number of items to show can now be customized.
